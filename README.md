# Logistic_regression_using-sklearn-matplotlib-pandas
### Aim
Here our goal is to predict whether a particular customer will respond positively when contacted as part of a marketing campaign.
The bank marketing dataset used in this project comes from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. link https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing

### Libraries used
- Numpy
- pandas
- sklearn
- scikit
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- We use these libraries to import, read , visualise, and analyse the dataset
### Approach
Logistic Regression
It is used to calculate or predict the probability of a binary (yes/no) event occurring. It is an example of supervised learning where we predict the probability of an event given the input data
###Result
Using Logistic Regression we achieved an accuracy of 80.7% which means 80.7% of the customers will reply positively on the marketing campaign.
